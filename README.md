# Kilimanjaro Designs - Product Overview Service 

> Kilimanjaro Designs is an e-commerce clothing retailer. For this project, I inherited legacy front-end code and was tasked with building an optimized back-end that could handle high web traffic. I worked with a team of two other engineers, each focusing on a different service. I personally was in charge of the Product Overview service.
